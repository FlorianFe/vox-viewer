# \<vox-viewer\>

uses [\<model-viewer\>](https://github.com/GoogleWebComponents/model-viewer) and acts like it, but takes .vox files 
which are exported by [Magicka Voxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/) as source instead of GLTF files. It also uses 
[voxel-triangulation.js](https://github.com/FlorianFe/voxel-triangulation.js) to build a mesh out of the voxel model and [vox-reader.js](https://github.com/FlorianFe/vox-reader.js) to parse vox files.
